# RadhaKrishna
This is my first python drawing using Turtle Package. Through this I have learned how to draw by coding in python.

# RadhaKrishna Turtle Art

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to create an artistic representation of Radha and Krishna. The code draws intricate details of their faces, hair, and accessories using various turtle movements and shapes.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed on your system.

pip install PythonTurtle

## Usage
Run the Python script, and a Turtle graphics window will open, displaying the beautiful artwork of Radha and Krishna. The program will automatically close after 120 seconds.

python radha_krishna_turtle.py

## Artwork Overview
The artwork consists of two turtles, 'b' representing Radha and 'c' representing Krishna.
Radha's face is drawn with intricate details, including eyes, nose, mouth, and hair.
Krishna's face is also detailed, featuring eyes, nose, mouth, and intricate hairstyles.
The 'd' turtle draws a decorative design resembling "pullangulal" at the bottom.
